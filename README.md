# Hi, I'm Khalid Alhajj! 👋
## 🚀 About Me

From managing Last Mile Delivery operations to building websites, my transition from logistics to web development and coding has been a thrilling journey. As a child, I had always been fascinated by the world of programming and coding, spending countless hours tinkering with software and building my own websites. However, my career in logistics and delivery took me down a different path, and it wasn't until years later that I finally decided to pursue my passion for coding.

Taking a leap of faith, I dedicated myself to learning full stack web development, immersing myself in the world of coding languages, frameworks, and design principles. Through countless hours of practice and hard work, I honed my skills and gained a deep understanding of the art of web development. I am excited to see where this new path will take me in the future. With a keen eye for design and a passion for innovation, I am ready to take on any challenge and build the next generation of cutting-edge web applications.

- ⚡️ Did you know that in the early days of computing, computer programmers used to "debug" their programs by literally removing bugs that were caught in their machines? Legend has it that one programmer even found a moth stuck in one of the circuits of her computer, leading to the term "debugging" to refer to the process of finding and fixing errors in code. Hence the term "bug" and "debugging" are widely used in programming and web development.
